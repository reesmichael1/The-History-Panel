The feature that originally won me over as an Opera user was the panels. Now that the sidebar is back in Opera 29, it's time to rebuild that functionality.

TODO:
* Add locales (help requested!)
* Collapse links from same domain into folder
* Save open/close state
* Search
* Ability to remove links from history
* Arrow key navigation
